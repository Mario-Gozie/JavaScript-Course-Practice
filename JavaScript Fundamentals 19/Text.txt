MODERN JAVASCRIPT DEVELOPMENT

Moodle: where codes are kept then shared in different parts of the project. 3rd party moodles can also be included in our code. There are thousands of them which are called packages. Developers share these third party moodle on the npm repository (NPM: Node Package Manager.) These packges are used for free in our own code. for example the popular react framework or JQuery or the leaflet library. To use download and use packages, we use the npm software installed in our computer.

STEPS WE TAKE IN BUILDING A REAL WORLD APPLICATION. 

1. WRITE AND ORGANIZE CODES USING MOODLES AND THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES NEED BE.
2. ARRANGE THE WHOLE MOODLE INTO ONE FOLDER. THIS IS CALLED BUNDLING. 
3. THEN BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME BROWSERS THAT DO NOT RUN MODERN JAVASCRIPT, WE HAVE CHANGE THE CODE TO OLD JAVASCRIP AND THIS IS CALLED TRANSPILING/POLYFILLING. THIS IS DONE WITH BABEL.
4. AFTERWARDS, EVERYTHING IS BUNDLED TO JAVASCRIPT. THIS STAGE IS CALLED THE PRODUCTION STAGE.

WE DO NOT PERFORM THESE PROCESSES BY OURSELVES. WE DO USE SPECIAL TOOL TO DO THIS. WE EITHER USE WEBPACK OR PARCEL. AND THESES ARE CALLED JAVASCRPT BUNDLERS. THEY TAKE ALL OUR CODE AND TRANFORM THEM INTO JAVASCRIPT BUNDLE. WEBPACK IS THE MOST POPULAR BUT IT CAN BE A BIT HARD AND CONFUSING TO SET IT UP BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT THAT NEEDS TO BE CONFIGURED MANUALLY IN ORDER TO MAKE IT WORK PROPERLY. PACEL IS A ZERO CONFIGURATION BUNDLER WHICH SIMPLY WORKS OUT OF THE BOX

IN THIS SECTION, WE ARE GOING TO USE PARCEL.

NPM ALLOW US TO DOWNLOAD AND MANAGE TOOLS EG LIVESERVER, PACEL, BABEL WHICH COVERTS FILES TO ES5.

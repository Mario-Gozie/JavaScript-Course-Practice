// We know that methods are simply functions attached to objects and for arrays to have methods, it means they are objects.

let arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];

// Slice Method: this takes part of an array without changing the original array.

console.log(arr.slice(2));
console.log(arr.slice(2, 4)); // this has the begining index as 2 aned the ending index as 4. but it will not print the value ant index 4.
console.log(arr.slice(-2)); // this will take the last two values of an array.
console.log(arr.slice(-1)); // this will take the last value of an array.
console.log(arr.slice(1, -2)); // this will take values from position 1 and ignore the last two values of an array.

// createing a shallow copy of an array using slice(). This will create the exact copy of the array. see below!
console.log(arr.slice());

// alternatively, this can be done using the spread operator.
console.log(...arr);

// SPLICE METHOD NB: this is different from slice.
// This works like slice but it changes the original array or mutate the array. see below!

console.log(arr.splice(2)); // this will remove all values from index 2 in the original array. see below to confirm. This shows that splice actually mutate the original array.
console.log(arr);
// splice plays an important role when you want to remove the last element/value of an array. see below!
console.log(arr.splice(-1));

// Redefining the array agiain

arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];

// splice also takes a second arguement which is number of element or values you want to delete.

arr.splice(1, 3); //All I am saying here is start from positon 1 and remove 3 values from the original array. see result below!
console.log(arr);

// REVERSE METHOD

// reassigning the arr variable.
arr = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];
const arr2 = ["j", "i", "h", "g", "f"]; // Just assuming that we are working with this array and we need to reverse it.
console.log(arr2.reverse()); // this puts array in the right order, while mutating the original array. run the code below to see that arr2 was really changed.
console.log(arr2);

// CONCAT METHOD. This is used to concatenate two arrays. it does not mutate any of the original arrays.

const letters = arr.concat(arr2);
console.log(letters);

// Alternatively as done earlier, a spread operator can be used to concat two arrays as above. this does not mutate any of the original arrays. see below!
console.log([...arr, ...arr2]);

// JOIN METHOD

console.log(letters.join(" - "));

// THE NEW AT METHOD.

const arr3 = [23, 11, 64]; // creating a new array

console.log(arr3[0]); // selecting the value at position 0
//Alternatively, the above can be done with the at method.

console.log(arr3.at(0)); // here we are equally getting the value at postion 0.

// But why is the at method peculiar? Let us look at ways to get the last value of an array.

console.log(arr[arr.length - 1]);
console.log(arr.slice(-1)[0]); // the [0] takes the value of arr.slice(-1) out of the array. it is like saying, give me the first value after slicing.

// The at method also works on strings. see below!

  if (moves > 0) {
    console.log(`You deposited ${moves}`);

  }
}

// TRYING IT OUT IN THE FOREACH METHOD. Now here, it is easier. the for each method can return the value, index and the array. what matters most is the order. The first arguement of the call back function is the element, the second arguement is the index while the last one is the entire array we are looping over.

movements.forEach(function (move, index, arr) {

  } else {
    console.log(`movement ${index + 1}: You withdrew ${Math.abs(move)}`);
  }
});

// WHEN SHOULD YOU USE ANY OF THE TWO (FOREACH AND FOR)? Well the continue and break does not work on the forEach at all. It will loop over the entire array and there is nothing that can be done about it.

// FOR EACH METHOD IN MAPS AND SETS.

// with a MAP
const currencies = new Map([
  ["USD", "United States dollar"],
  ["EUR", "Euro"],

// calling forEach on the set
currenciesUnique.forEach(function (value, key, whole) {
  console.log(`${key}: ${value}`); //This will print USD: USD, GDP: GDP, EUR: EUR. this is because a set has no key and its not ordered, so it equally has no index.

/*
Julia and kate are doing a study on dogs. so each of them asked 5 dog owners about theeir dog's age and stored the data into an array (one array for each) for now, they are just interested in knowing whether the dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult of it is at least 3 years old, and it is a puppy if it is less than 3 years old.

Create a funcion 'checkDogs', which accept two arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things.

1. Julia found out that the owners of the FIRST  and LAST TWO dogs actually have cats, not dogs! so create a shallow copy of julia's array, and remove the cat ages from that copied array (because it's is a bad practice to mutate function parameters.)

2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data.

3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's adult ('Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy üêï‚Äçü¶∫")

4. Run the function for both test datasets.

HINT: Use tools from all lectures in this section so far.üòä

TEST DATA 1: Julia's data [3,5,2,12,7], Kate's data [4,1,15,8,3]
TEST DATA 2: Julia's data [9,16,6,8,3], Kate's data [10,5,6,1,4]

GOOD LUCK üòä

  const correctedJuliaDogs = dogsJulia.slice(); //This creates a new copy of the dogsJulia

  //Alternatively, you can use the spread operator. see below!
  // const corectedJuliaDogs = [...dogsJulia];

  //Remember that it was found out that the dogsJulia was wrong because the first and last 2 were cats. so let me correct it better. using the splice method. remember that it mutates the original array.

  correctedJuliaDogs.splice(0, 1); // Here I am saying I want to remove element at position 0 and just only one element in total.
  correctedJuliaDogs.splice(-2, 2); // Here I am saying I want to remove element at position -2 and just only tw0 elements in total.

  // ALTERNATIVE.
  // the whole splice process of creating a new correct dog age array of dogsJulia would have be done using slice method in one step and put into a new variable. see below!

  // const correctJuliaDogs = dogsJulia.slice(1, -2) // this simply says I want to slice from the second element to the last two. remember that arrays are zero based and that the last value in a slice is not always selected.

// SOME BIG ARRAY METHODS USED IN JAVASCRIPT. (THESE METHODS ARE VERY IMPORTANT.)
// THEY ARE MAP FILTER AND REDUCE

// MAP: Map is another method that can be used to loop over arrays. it is similar to the FOREACH Method but it creates a brand new array based on the original array. in other words, it takes an array, loops over it, apply a callback function specified in our code, and then return an array. A good example is multiplying each element by 2 and returning an array  of all the values.

// FILTER: This is used to filter for elements in the original array which satisfy a particular condition eg, looking for elements greater than 2.

// REDUCE: This is used to boil down all elemetns of the original array into one single value. an example of this is to add all elements of an array together. for the example of adding all numbers in an array, This requires specifying an operation that has an accumulator variable. so as the reduce method loop over the array, it keeps adding the current method onto the accumulator until the end of the loop, you have the total sum of the elements.

// MAP METHOD IN PRACTICE. converting the movement data to dollars. we area assuming that it is in Euro and that 1 Euro = 1.1 dollars.
// Remember that this will give a new array.

  // once you understand the FOREACH method, both map, filter and reduce will be easier to uncerstand because all takes a callback function.

});

// simplifying the Map method with Arrow function

// NEXT VIDEO
// WORKING WITH ARRAYS
// Previous ways we created arrays

const arrsr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7];
console.log(new Array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7));

const x = new Array(7); // this will create a new array with 7 empty spaces. This shows that when we use the new Array function with only one value inside, it creates spaces of that value that could be filled later. this can be done with the fill method
console.log(x);

// x.fill(1); //  This fills the x arry with 1 seven times
// You can also specify where you want the fill method to start filling. i could be from index 3 see below.

// x.fill(1, 3); // here 3 is the begin parameter

// You can also specify the end parameter but know that just like in slice, there wont be value for that positon of the end parameter. lets use index 5 as an example
x.fill(1, 3, 5);

console.log(x);

// the fill method mutates the original array

arrsr.fill(23, 4, 6); // here I am saying, put 23 at position 4 - 6. remember that position 6 wont be filled.
console.log(arrsr);

// What if we want to create this array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] Progamatically? we use the Array.from. The Array.from() takes a callback function
const y = Array.from({ length: 7 }, () => 1); // so here, I a saying create an array of length 7 and then, using an arrow function, I said put only 1 into the indexes.
console.log(y); // This shows the arry of 1

const z = Array.from({ length: 7 }, (curr, i) => i + 1); //Remember that the Array.from takes a callback function. and it is just like that in map funtion. here I am simply saying, take the current and index, then return index + 1

// You can still remove that "curr" argument because it is not need here. in such case, you replace it with an underscore. "_" see below!
// const z = Array.from({ length: 7 }, (_, i) => i + 1);
console.log(z);

// MORE USE CASES OF THE ARRAY.FROM() FUNCTION.
// array.from is very valuable when creating arrays from other things. eg, maps and sets. Provided they are iterable.
// see the App code file for very good examples.

// LETS PRACTICE WITH ARRAY METHODS A BIT FIRST.

// Exercise 1 We want to calculate how much deposited in all the accounts in the bank

const bankDepositSum = accounts
  .map((acc) => acc.movements)
  .flat()
  .filter((deposit) => deposit > 0)
  .reduce((acc, deposit) => acc + deposit, 0);
console.log(bankDepositSum);

// The above can be done alternatively with flatmap

const AllBankDeposit = accounts
  .flatMap((acc) => acc.movements)
  .filter((deposit) => deposit > 0)
  .reduce((acc, deposit) => acc + deposit, 0);

console.log(AllBankDeposit);

// Execise 2: How many deposit of atleast 1000 dollars

const NumDeposits1000 = accounts
  .flatMap((acc) => acc.movements)
  .filter((deposit) => deposit >= 1000)
  .reduce((acc, curr, i, arr) => i + 1, 0); // Here, I am basically increasing the index to get the total transactions that were up to 1000. remember that the index starts at 0 for arrays. and that reduce method takes an index as an arguement.

console.log(NumDeposits1000);

// Alternative

const NumDepo1000 = accounts
  .flatMap((acc) => acc.movements)
  .filter((deposit) => deposit >= 1000).length;

console.log(NumDepo1000);

// Another Alternative

const NumDep1000 = accounts
  .flatMap((acc) => acc.movements)
  .reduce((count, curr) => (curr >= 1000 ? count + 1 : count), 0); // Here, I am saying if the count is greater than 1000, add 1 to the count. if not return count. Remember count is starting at 0

console.log(NumDep1000);

// EXERCISE 3: Creating a new object with the reduce method.
// create an object that contains all deposit and all withdrawal.

const sums = accounts
  .flatMap((acc) => acc.movements)
  .reduce(
    (sum, curr) => {
      curr > 0 ? (sum.deposits += curr) : (sum.withdrawals += curr); //here I am saying if the current value is > than 0, add it to the deposits property of the sum arguement. if it is not, add it to the withdrawal property of the sum arguement.
      return sum; // when working with a function that has curly braces, you must explicitly use the return statement. but when you are not like in the tasks above, using an arrow function, it will be done automatically.
    },
    { deposits: 0, withdrawals: 0 }
  );

// in the above code, we can see that the object created is sum. whicih is the sums as a reduce argument. that is why we have sum.deposits and  sum.withdrawal.

console.log(sums);

// YOU CAN EVEN DISTRUCTURE THEM SEE BELOW.

const { depositss, withdrawalss } = accounts
  .flatMap((acc) => acc.movements)
  .reduce(
    (sum, curr) => {
      curr > 0 ? (sum.depositss += curr) : (sum.withdrawalss += curr); //here I am saying if the current value is > than 0, add it to the deposits property of the sum arguement. if it is not, add it to the withdrawal property of the sum arguement.
      return sum; // when working with a function that has curly braces, you must explicitly use the return statement. but when you are not like in the tasks above, using an arrow function, it will be done automatically.
    },
    { depositss: 0, withdrawalss: 0 }
  );

console.log(depositss, withdrawalss);

// EXECISE 4: CREATING A FUNCTION THAT WOULD CAPITALIZE THE FIRST LETTER OF EVERY WORD, EXCEPT FOR SOME EXEPTIONS. see below!

// this is a nice title => This Is a Nice title.

const convertTitleCase = function (title) {
  const exceptions = [`a`, `an`, `the`, `and`, `but`, `or`, `on`, `in`, `with`];

  const titleCase = title
    .toLowerCase()
    .split(" ")
    .map(
      (word) =>
        exceptions.includes(word) ? word : word[0].toUpperCase() + word.slice(1) //Here I am simply saying. while looping over each word, if the word is included in the exception (remember the include method returns a boolean), dont capitalize else. capitalize the first letter and join others which starts from index 1.
    )
    .join(" "); // Here I am joining the array back with the space.

  return titleCase;
